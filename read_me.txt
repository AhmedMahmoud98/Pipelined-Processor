To run any test case:

1. Create project and add all vhdl files.
2. Compile all files 3 times to resolve dependencies.
3. do Scripts/run_<case>.tcl

This runs the assembler to generate the memory text file, loads the file and runs the appropriate test case.
The memory text files are provided just in case.
